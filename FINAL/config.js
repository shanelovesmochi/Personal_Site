    <h3>Pre-cleanup contamination</h3>
    <p>Soil sample testing at Willets Point reveals widespread exceedance of regulatory standards (RURR) across multiple pollutant categories. Here are the most severe contaminations:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
      <li>• VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)</li>
      <li>• SVOC (Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds)</li>
      <li>• METAL (Heavy Metals & Inorganic Pollutants)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>VOC: Volatile Organic Compounds</h4>
    <p>VOCs such as 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene, Acetone, and Benzene were frequently detected above RURR standards. These compounds are typically associated with:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
      <li>• Industrial solvents</li>
      <li>• Vehicle and machinery fuel residues</li>
      <li>• Past auto repair shop activities in Willets Point</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Health Impact:</strong> Many VOCs are linked to respiratory issues, neurological symptoms, and even carcinogenic risks (e.g., benzene).</p>

    <h4>SVOC: Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds</h4>
    <p>SVOCs include Benzo(a)pyrene, Chrysene, and Fluoranthene — all components of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), often resulting from:</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
      <li>• Incomplete combustion of fuel</li>
      <li>• Leaks and spills from mechanical operations</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Health Impact:</strong> PAHs are known carcinogens. Chronic exposure is associated with skin, lung, and bladder cancers.</p>

    <h4>METALS: Heavy Metals & Inorganics</h4>
    <p>Metals such as Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, and Lead show significant exceedance, some more than 100x the RURR standard. Some metals like Chromium VI and Lead are especially concerning due to their toxicity at even low concentrations.</p>
    <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
      <li>• Auto dismantling operations</li>
      <li>• Industrial dumping</li>
      <li>• Battery waste</li>
      <li>• Metal plating</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Health Impact:</strong> Heavy metals can damage neurological development, liver and kidney function, and lead to lifelong chronic illnesses.</p>

      <p>RURR: Restricted Use - Restricted Residential Soil Cleanup Objectives. </p>
      <p>RURR applies to residential sites with restrictions—such as engineered barriers or land-use controls. It's less strict than full residential standards, but more protective than commercial or industrial ones. Commonly used in brownfield projects like Willets Point, where housing is allowed but with environmental safeguards.</p>

        <p><strong>VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Vinyl Chloride</strong><br>
        Most test points exceed the RURR standard by more than 10 times. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen primarily associated with liver cancer.</p>

        <p><strong>1,2-Dichloroethane</strong><br>
        Approximately half of the data points exceed the RURR standard by 5–20 times. This compound is a probable carcinogen and may cause damage to the nervous system, liver, and kidneys.</p>

        <p><strong>Benzene</strong><br>
        Several exceedance points are 10 times or more above RURR. Benzene is a well-established carcinogen linked to leukemia. Its repeated exceedance suggests a persistent and dangerous presence in the local environment.</p>

        <p><strong>SVOC (Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Benzo(a)pyrene</strong><br>
        Most samples exceed the RURR standard by 10–50 times. A highly potent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), Benzo(a)pyrene is one of the most toxic PAHs, with strong carcinogenic and mutagenic properties.</p>

        <p><strong>Dibenz(a,h)anthracene</strong><br>
        Test points show exceedances ranging from 10 times to nearly 100 times RURR. This SVOC is classified as a probable human carcinogen and shares toxicity pathways similar to Benzo(a)pyrene.</p>

        <p><strong>Chrysene</strong><br>
        A large proportion of data points exceed RURR by 5–30 times. Though slightly less potent than the two above, Chrysene is still a suspected carcinogen and indicates a significant environmental health risk.</p>

        <p><strong>METALS</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Cadmium</strong><br>
        Several test values exceed RURR by 10–50 times. Cadmium is a toxic metal known to cause kidney damage and is classified as a human carcinogen.</p>

        <p><strong>Arsenic</strong><br>
        Most values range from 5 to 20 times above RURR. Arsenic is a potent toxin and carcinogen associated with skin, lung, and bladder cancers. Chronic exposure even at low levels poses serious risks.</p>

        <p><strong>Lead</strong><br>
        While the median remains close to RURR, some samples exceed the standard by 5–15 times. Lead exposure is particularly harmful to children, causing irreversible neurological damage. Its presence above safe limits warrants immediate concern.</p>

      <p>While the official brownfield cleanup involved the removal of contaminated soils—typically up to 2 to 8 feet deep, and in some cases up to 15 feet—these efforts largely targeted known hotspots identified through pre-selected borings. However, site-wide contamination profiles suggest that pollutants such as heavy metals and SVOCs may persist beyond the excavated zones.</p>
      <p>The cleanup prioritized surface-level remediation sufficient for construction clearance, but may not fully address long-term subsurface exposure risks. This is particularly notable given that the site’s future use includes residential housing, where deeper soil layers could be disturbed during foundation work or utility installation. <p>

RURR is designed for sites with limited human exposure, such as industrial or commercial zones, not for places where children will play, families will garden, and residents will live long-term. Yet Willets Point, one of the city’s largest affordable housing projects in decades, has been assessed under this lenient threshold.
